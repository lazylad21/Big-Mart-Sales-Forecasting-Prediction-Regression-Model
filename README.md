# Big-Mart-Sales-Forecasting-Prediction-Regression-Model

 This project involves analyzing a dataset that contains various features such as item weight, visibility, and store location, and building a predictive model that can accurately forecast the sales of each product in different stores.
 The ultimate goal is to help store owners optimize their operations by accurately predicting sales, 
 improving inventory management, and making informed decisions about pricing and promotions.
 
<h>Dataset Description</h>
 
 The BigMart Sales Prediction project involves analyzing a dataset of sales data collected by BigMart from 2013. The dataset contains information on 1559 different products sold across 10 different stores located in various cities. The dataset contains 12 attributes, including Item Fat, Item Type, Item MRP, Outlet Type, Item Visibility, Item Weight, Outlet Identifier,
 Outlet Size, Outlet Establishment Year, Outlet Location Type, Item Identifier, and Item Outlet Sales.
